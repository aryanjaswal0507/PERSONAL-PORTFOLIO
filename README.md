## Key Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Data Manipulation Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning Library**: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- **Data Serialization**: Pickle
- **Frontend Development**: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)

## Data Processing and Model Development

- Explored key features such as `year`, `company`, `fuel_type`, and `Price` to understand their distributions.
- Cleaned the data by removing missing values and filtering non-numeric entries, enhancing dataset integrity.
- Employed one-hot encoding for categorical variables to prepare them for the machine learning model.
- Split the data into training and testing sets, ensuring diversity for better model generalization.
- Developed and fine-tuned a linear regression model, achieving a high RÂ² score for predictive accuracy.
- Serialized the model using Pickle for seamless integration into the Flask web application.

## Outcome

The application delivers precise car price predictions based on user inputs, showcasing the effective integration of machine learning with web technologies. This project highlights the importance of data preprocessing and model optimization in creating reliable predictive solutions.
